# Statistical-Modelling
Scope:
The purpose of the project was to identify & fit the most efficient model that has a better prediction rate for the dependent variable. To account for the requirements various regression models were applied to the dataset that caters to all kinds of parametersâ€”analyzing the metrics for different regressor models aimed at fitting the data well to reduce the differences between the observed values and the model's predicted values. The analysis and comparison found that R2 and RMSE values were strong indicators of a good fit for the models. Based on the analysis Polynomial Regression model produced a higher efficiency and less mean square error value.
